e3.2 C3.3
firing sequence- is a sequence of transistions which tansform some markig M to marking M'

reachability- is defined by chcecking if any requested (or some given)  marking may be reached 

liveness-Petri net is live if each of its trasitions are live. Transition t is live if it can be fired for any of reachable marking.

boudedness- A place in Petri net is called k-bounded if it does not contain more than k tokens in all reachable markings, including the initial marking; it is said to be safe if it is 1-bounded; it is bounded if it is k-bounded for some k .

reversible net- A Petri Net is said to be reversible if for each marking M, M0 is reachable from M. So in a reversible net one can alwayes get back to the initial marking.

coverable marking - If transition t can be fired in marking M, then t can be fired in Mâ€™.
