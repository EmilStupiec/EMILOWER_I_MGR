
firing sequence- is a sequence of transistions which tansform some markig M to marking M'

reachability- is defined by chcecking if any requested (or some given)  marking may be reached 

liveness-Petri net is live if each of its trasitions are live. Transition t is live if it can be fired for any of reachable marking.

boudedness- petri net is bouded if capacity of each place in the  net is definied.

reversible net- A Petri Net is said to be reversible if for each marking M, M0 is reachable from M. So in a reversible net one can alwayes get back to the initial marking.

coverable marking - If transition t can be fired in marking M, then t can be fired in Mâ€™.
